I work as a PhD student in the *Signals in the Sea* working group, with [Erik Selander](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Erik-Selander) as supervisor.<br>
I am broadly interested in ecology and ecophysiology, especially in aquatic environments, but also biostatistics, experimental design and science communication.

My research focuses on phytoplankton responses to chemical cues released by copepods, called copepodamides, and the consequences of these responses at individual to ecosystem scales.<br>
Copepods, and copepodamides alone, have been shown to induce a wide variety of different defensive mechanism. They induce toxin production in harmful algae, bioluminescence (svenska: mareld), induce silification and supress chain-formation of diatoms, alter the swimming behaviour of motile dinoflagellates, and induce changes in the diel feeding behaviour of marine protists.
